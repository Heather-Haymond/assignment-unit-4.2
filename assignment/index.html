        <h3 class="h3">I already have a bike that I was gifted. It needs new breaks and the frame is a bit small for me. As I was looking into how to fix it up myself or weather I would end up paying for the service, I met up with a friend for lunch first... as I was walking back to my car I found this bike on the corner, unlocked wit a "free, pass it on" sign... and I feel like the luckiest person manifesting their dreams. I am SO fortunate to have this to get to school and back</h3>
